# Webcam-imaging-based-readout-for-BiMW
The software includes routines for capturing and analyzing mode images from femtosecond-laser micromachined bimodal waveguides to identify the region of maximum sensitivity within the two overlapped modes. As the micromachined waveguides are not perfectly uniform or circular in cross-section, the optimal offset cannot be determined theoretically. Therefore, the provided codes implement a novel image-processing-based method to optimize the sensor performance by scanning the region of interest (ROI) across mode images obtained for varying analyte refractive indices, identifying the ROI corresponding to maximum modulation depth.
